### Features and Traits
**Dexterous Feet:** As a bonus action, you can use your feet to manipulate an object, open or close a door or container, or pick up or set down a tiny object.
**Glide:** When you fall at least 10 feet above the groud, you can use your reaction to extend your skin membranes to glide horizontally a number of feet equal to your walking speed, and you take 0 damage from the fall. You determine the direction of the glide. 
**Hadozee Resistance:** The magic that runs in your veins heightens your natural defenses. When you take damage, you can use your reaction to roll a d6. Add your proficiency bonus to the number rolled, and reduce the damge you take by an amount equal to that total. You can use this trait a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus. You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest. 

**Magical Tinkering:** You've learned how to invest a spark of magic into mundane objects. To use this ability, you must have thieves' tools or artisan's tools in hand. You then touch a tiny nonmagical object as an action and give it one of the following magical properties of your choice:
- The object sheds bright light in a 5-foot radius and dim light for an additional 5 feet.
- Whenever tapped by a creature, the object emits a recorded message that can be heard up to 10 feet away. You utter the message when you bestow this property on the object, and the recording can be no more than 6 seconds long.
- The object continuously emits your choice of an odor or a nonverbal sound (wind, waves, chirping, or the like). The chosen phenomenon is percievable up to 10 feet away.
- A static visual effect appears on one of the object's surfaces. This effect can be a picture, up to 25 words of text, lines and shapes, or a mixture of these elements as you like.
The property lasts indefinitely. As an action, you can touch the object and the property ends. 
You can do this with multiple objects, but an object can have only one property at a time.
The maximum number of objects you can effect with this is equal to your intelligence modifier (minimum of 1.) If you try to exceed your maximum, the oldest property immediately ends, and the new one applies.
