### Modified Resting
- Players cannot take a long rest unless they are completely safe (i.e. in a town, or a cabin in the woods).
- They can, however, take short rests, but on a roll of a 4 (1d4), a random encounter triggers. 
- This nerfs long rest casters, so also implemented is a feature called slot dice. 
- A long rest caster has slot dice equal to their proficiency bonus and they can roll any number of them on a short rest.
- Each slot dice is a d4.
- They regain spell slots of their choice equal to the total they rolled on their slot dice.
- They regain half of their slot dice rounded down at the end of a long rest. 

### Modified AC
- Players subtract 10 from their armour class.
- This is now their armour score (a maximum of 4 + their level).
- No more rolling to hit, attacks always hit.
- When a creature is hit, their armour score is subtracted from the damage.
- When a creature would have advantage to hit, instead of rolling with advantage, they ignore their enemy's armour score.
- When you roll the maximum number on your damage die and you would have had to roll to hit, that is now a crit and you can roll again.
- Crits can stack by rolling the maximum number several times in a row.
