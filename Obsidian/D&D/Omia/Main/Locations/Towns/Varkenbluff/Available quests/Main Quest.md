The players should arrive at the dock. They will be greeted by the shipwright, [[Shelly the Shipwright]]. She will take their boat and make sure it is safe should they need it again. She will take them to the town and direct them to anywhere they should wish to go, and tell them where the mayor, [[Stockholm the Strong]]'s, office is after they've loitered satisfactorily. The mayor tells them about a problem that Omia has been having: a mad wizard in his tower to the far north is creating a growing bubble of supernatural nature. We donâ€™t know what is inside the bubble, because nobody who has gone in has come out. Stockholm suggests that the players get a little more powerful before investigating, but he still highly recommends it. He will say that the characters next destination is Waypoint Fort to the north through the fields, as it is the only way to go north from here.
