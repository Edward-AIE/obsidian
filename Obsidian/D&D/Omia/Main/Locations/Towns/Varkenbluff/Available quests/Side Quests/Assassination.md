A woman ([[Rimar Dhelil]]) in the Warlock’s Whiskey tavern informs the players of a secret criminal guild that are causing chaos in the town. 

She informs the players that the leader of the guild spends most of his time accosting people in the southern sect of town. 

She thinks that if he is taken out, the guild will disband, but if the players don’t do it stealthily the guild will hear about it and will know it was them and will hunt them down to an extent that makes them effectively unwelcome in Varkenbluff here on out.
