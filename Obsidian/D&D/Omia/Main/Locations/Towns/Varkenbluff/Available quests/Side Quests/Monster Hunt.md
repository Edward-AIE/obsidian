A Bulette, says a dwarf ([[Selkath]]) in the Drunken Dragonborn, is terrorizing the town. It only comes out in the evening, and it attacks from the southwest. He wants is gone.

The bulette harrasses farmers working their land to the southwest. By the time the players know, there is only one farmland plot that hasn't been ruined and had all the grain eaten by the bulette, so it is obvious which one it will attack next.

Corn fields are difficult terrain, and the whole combat area is a corn field.
