The crime boss is a human [[Bandit Captain]] named Jack Ironladel. He steals everything he can, and as a strong man with a strong following, nobody is courageous enough to take him down. 
He tends to hang around the south part of town, threatening people and taking their things. 
This mainly occurs at night, when the streets are quiet.
