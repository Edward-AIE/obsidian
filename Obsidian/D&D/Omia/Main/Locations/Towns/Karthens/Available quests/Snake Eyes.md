1.  Gather two dice and a group of players. The game can be played with any number of players.
2.  Decide who goes first. The first player will roll both dice.
3.  The goal of the game is to roll a "snake eyes," which is a roll of two ones. If the player rolls a snake eyes, they win the game.
4.  If the first player does not roll snake eyes, they can choose to keep their score and end their turn or they can choose to roll again. If they choose to roll again, they must roll both dice and add their scores together.
5.  If at any point a player rolls a total of seven, they lose their turn and their score is reset to zero. The turn then passes to the next player.
6.  Play continues in this manner until one player rolls a snake eyes and wins the game.
