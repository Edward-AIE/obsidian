The campaign begins in the Thirsty Troll tavern (the owner of which is [[Keoghan the Mighty]]), the only one in town. The mayor of the town, [[Hannah Willowbrook]], recognises the players as residents of Karthens and suggests that they help her. 

She explains that there has been suspicious activity between townsfolk and goblins in the surrounding forests, involving transaction of suspiciously pure-coloured apples for inexplicable amounts of gold. She wants the players to find out what is going on. 

The mayor has spoken to the characters about this now, because, at the winter solstice, this is the time of year when the transactions generally occur. In fact, the day after the winter solstice is generally the time of transaction. She suggests the players stake out at a couple of locations around town looking for suspicious behaviour, and if they find anything, follow or interrogate who they find.


If the players stake out the area, one or more of them should find that a human engaging in suspicious activity late at night is met with a goblin carrying a perfectly white apple. The apple is exchanged for 50GP and they both go on their way. If the players follow or interrogate the goblin, they find that he is going to a ravine in the woods. If they do neither, they at least have the direction the goblin went in.
