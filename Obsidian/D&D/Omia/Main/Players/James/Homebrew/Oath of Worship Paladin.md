The Oath of the Worship are often a more extreme set of rules than the normal rules of worship of a god, giving power through gifts given by the god they worship.

**Loyalty.** If you betray your god’s tenets after you make the oath of worship, you lose your powers and depending on your god, perish.
**Law.** You must respect all of your order, no matter if they are the head of the church or the 
**Sacrifice.** The only way to gain more spells is to carve them onto your body, as there must be a constant reminder to you that you are merely borrowing your powers from a greater being.

### Aura Of Devotion
Beginning at 7th level, ancient magic lies so heavily upon you that it forms an eldritch ward. You and friendly creatures within 10 feet of you have resistance to damage from spells.

### Unyielding Devotion
Starting at 15th level, when reduced to 0 hp, you can keep yourself up for extra turns, but you automatically fail the death save needed to be made in said turn, and any damage take is one failed save, same as always. While this occurs, you cannot heal yourself.
