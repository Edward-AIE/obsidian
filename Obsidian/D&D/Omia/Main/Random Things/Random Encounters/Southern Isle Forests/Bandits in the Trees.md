There are 6 [[Bandit]]s hiding in the trees.

As the players are passing through, get them to make a perception check against the bandits' collective stealth check (6d20+6 divided by 6).

After this, regardless of results, 4 of them (the most revealed ones) jump out of the trees and attack. 2 rounds later, or when all other bandits are killed or defeated, the rest of them jump out.
