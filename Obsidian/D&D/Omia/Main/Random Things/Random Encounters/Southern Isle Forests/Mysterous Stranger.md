"You hear rustling in the leaves directly behind you"

If the players turn around, they see an old elf man who has no business being in a forest like this.
He says "Hello travelers, do you have any spare change?" 

In the event that he is supplied with spare change, he gives the characters a bag. The bag, on an arcana check of 10-15, seems like a bag of holding. 15+, however, discerns that it is actually a bag of devouring.
