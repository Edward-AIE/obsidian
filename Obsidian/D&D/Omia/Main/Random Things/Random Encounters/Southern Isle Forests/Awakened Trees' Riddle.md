"On either side of you, you hear crackling, snapping sounds coming from the trees. You notice that 4 trees, two on either side, have cracked open two eyes and a mouth each. One of them says "We will let you pass under one condition: You prove your worth by answering our riddle of the forest.""

All 4 of them are [[awakened trees]], and if the players try to pass without answering the riddle, they attempt to grapple the players.

The riddle of the forest is "I touch your face, I'm in your words, I'm lack of space and beloved by birds. What am I?"
The answer is "Air." After the players get the riddle right, the awakened trees let them past.
