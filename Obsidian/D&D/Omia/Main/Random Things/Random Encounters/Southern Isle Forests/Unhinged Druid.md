"A [[5e/Creatures/Druid]] is sitting in a tree. He looks as unwashed as his clothes, with long, straight, dark greasy hair. His eyes suggest madness and occult secrets. He looks down at you like a deer in headlights and says "...". He doesn't say anything. Just continues to stare."

If questioned, the druid speaks gibberish to the players and then jumps away from tree to tree.
