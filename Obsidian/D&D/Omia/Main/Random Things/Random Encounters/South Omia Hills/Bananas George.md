The characters come across a cave containing a man wearing torn up rags on the ground eating bananas (at what you can only assume is roughly 63 bananas per second) that come out of an extradimensional portal. 
He does not stand up, instead he turns his eyes to the characters and says, telepathically,

"I am bananas george. I eat 2 billion bananas per year. It has been this way for over 6 years, when i was cursed to eat bananas for all eternity. The bananas have given me capabilities beyond comprehension. Do not come near me, for I have a radioactive aura caused by the bananas."
