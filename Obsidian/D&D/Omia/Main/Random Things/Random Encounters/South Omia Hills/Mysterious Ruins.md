The ruins of something that is no longer recognisable. 
It is currently home to 8 [[goblin]]s and an [[ogre]] who are all asleep if it is night. 
There is a chest in the ruins that contains a pair of Boots of Elvenkind and 15 GP.
The chest is locked and the key is on the belt of one of the goblins (assign each goblin a number and roll 1d8)
