###### The once idyllic town of Oakhurst takes on an eerie and unsettling atmosphere. The moon casts an ethereal glow over the landscape, casting long shadows that seem to dance and twist in the wind. The air is thick with a palpable sense of unease as if the very fabric of the night holds secrets best left undisturbed. 

###### As one wanders through the desolate streets the laughter and conversation have faded away, replaced by an unsettling stillness broken only by the side ant hooting of an owl or the rustling of leaves in the wind. 

The town is currently cursed by a [[False Hydra]] that is casting a curse in a cave deep under the city.
