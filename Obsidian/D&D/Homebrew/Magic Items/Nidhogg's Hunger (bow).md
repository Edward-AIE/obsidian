**| Magic bow | 300GP | Legendary | Attunement |**

Nidhogg's Hunger is a beautifully crafted longbow made of jagged Svirfneblin steel. It has horns on either end and looks almost to be made out of thick black brambles.

It works the same as a normal longbow, except it fires three arrows at once (while consuming only one), all dealing 1d10 instead of 1d8. Furthermore, enemies slain by Nidhogg's Hunger cannot be revived and do not get death saves.

Without attunement, Nidhogg's Hunger is a regular longbow.

The weapon is sentient and communicates only to attuned creatures through telepathy. It has a dark, grumbling voice, and often tells creatures to do horrible things with it, such as killing party members. The bow is Chaotic Evil.

"As you draw closer to the blackened brambles that twist around the gnarled Svirfneblin steel, you can almost hear the hungry growls emanating from the jagged horns on either end of the bow. The sharp, angular edges of the bow gleam menacingly. As you approach, the horns on either end of the bow seem to pulse with a dark energy that makes your skin crawl. The bow almost seems to be alive, writhing in your grasp as you take it up. The horns on either end of the weapon seem to twitch and snarl, as if eager to taste blood."
