### Half-Elf Variants

-   Some half-elves in Faerun have a racial trait in place of the Skill Versatility trait. If your DM allows it, your half-elf character can forgo Skill Versatility and instead take the elf trait Keen Senses or one of the following traits based on your elf parentage:
    -   _**Elf Weapon Training (High or Wood Elf Heritage).**_ You have proficiency with the longsword, shortsword, shortbow, and longbow.
    -   _**Cantrip (High Elf Heritage).**_ You know one cantrip of your choice from the wizard spell list. Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for it.
    -   _**Fleet of Foot (Wood Elf Heritage).**_ Your base walking speed increases to 35 feet.
    -   _**Mask of the Wild (Wood Elf Heritage).**_ You can attempt to hide even when you are only lightly obscured by foliage, heavy rain, falling snow, mist, and other natural phenomena.
    -   _**Drow Magic (Dark Elf Heritage).**_ You know the Dancing Lights cantrip. When you reach 3rd level, you can cast Faerie Fire once, and it recharges after a long rest. When you reach 5th level, you can cast Darkness once, and it recharges after a long rest. Charisma is your spellcasting ability for these spells.
    -   _**Swim Speed (Sea Elf Heritage).**_ You have a swimming speed of 30 feet.
